# Song-Project
This Python project allows users to check the title and artist of a song based on its position in a top 100 chart. By entering the song's position number (1 through 100), users will get the song's title, its artist, and an indication of its ranking, such as whether it is in the Top 10, Top 50, or Top 100.

Features
Song Lookup: Users can input a position number (1-100) to find the corresponding song title and artist.

Ranking Information: The program will inform users whether the song is in the Top 10, Top 50, or Top 100.

Input Validation: Ensures that the position number is between 1 and 100, providing an error message if the input is out of range.
